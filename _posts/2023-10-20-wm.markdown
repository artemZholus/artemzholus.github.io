The new **State-of-the-Art performance** in a diverse set of **memory-intense Reinforcement Learning** domains: **bsuite** (tabular, low dimensional), **POPgym** (tabular, high dimensional), **Memory Maze** (3D, embodied, high dimensional, long-term). We also show the performance is not dropped in non-memory RL tasks.
