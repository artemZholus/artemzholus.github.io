BindGPT is a new framework for building drug discovery models that leverages *compute-efficient pretraining*, *supervised funetuning*, *prompting*, *reinforcement learning*, and *tool use of LMs*. This allows BindGPT to build a single pre-trained model that exhibits state-of-the-art performance in **3D Molecule Generation**, **3D Conformer Generation**, **Pocket-Conditioned 3D Molecule Generation**, posing them as downstream tasks for a pretrained model, while previous methods build task-specialized models without task transfer abilities.
